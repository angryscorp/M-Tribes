# M-Tribes

The app should access a JSON feed of cars: http://data.m-tribes.com/locations.json

It should persist them and display the information in two different sections:
<li>Section 1: Display all the cars information in a list.</li>
<li>Section 2: Display all the cars in the map (plus the user's updated location).</li>
<br/>
After tapping a car on the map, the others should disappear and the car name should be displayed on top of the map pin, tapping again on the car will hide the car name and show again the other cars' pins.
